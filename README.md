## Transformer-based Autoencoder with GAN-based Data Augmentation

### Overview:
This script demonstrates the implementation of a Transformer-based autoencoder combined with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based data augmentation for time-series data. It involves:

1. **Data Loading**: Loading time-series data from CSV files.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizing the features using StandardScaler.
3. **Model Architecture**:
   - Transformer Autoencoder: A neural network architecture utilizing TransformerEncoderLayer for encoding and decoding time-series data.
   - Generator: A generator model for GAN-based data augmentation.
   - Discriminator: A discriminator model for GAN-based data augmentation.
4. **Loss Functions**:
   - Autoencoder Loss: Reconstruction loss for the autoencoder.
   - Discriminator Loss: Adversarial loss for the discriminator.
   - Generator Loss: Adversarial loss for the generator.
5. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Utilizes GAN-based data augmentation to generate synthetic data for enhancing the training dataset.
6. **Training Loop**:
   - Alternately trains the autoencoder, discriminator, and generator using the respective loss functions.
7. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Anomaly detection is enabled during training to identify and handle NaN values.
8. **Training Configuration**:
   - Configured for a fixed number of epochs with batch-wise training.

### Usage:
1. **Dependencies**:
   - PyTorch
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - scikit-learn

2. **Setup**:
   - Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed.
  

3. **Training**:
   - Execute the script in a Python environment or a compatible platform like Google Colab.
   - Monitor training progress through epoch-wise loss logs.
   - Adjust training parameters or model architecture based on performance and requirements.
